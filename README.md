# Maps & Local storage exercise

----

## Task

Prepare an Ionic 2/3 app to display Google maps with userâ€™s current location based on GPS .

Acceptance Criteria:


- [x] Use Ionic Native plugin for Geolocation
- [x] The user location should have a circle around user location with radius proportional to maps zoom level.
- [x] Geopoint changes have to be written in a database of your choice
- [x] On failing to get GPS data, an empty view has to be displayed to notify user to turn on Location services.


Using lazy loading and optimizing the app performance is a plus. Use your artistic discretion to design the view. No further explanation is provided to complete the task.


## Abstract

In this example, the app has a map in two pages `Home` and `Contact`.

The `MapProvider` keeps only one map instance, and reuse it.

----

## How to run this example?

```
$> git clone https://github.com/shashwathuchil04/ieee-task.git

$> cd ieee-task

// config.xml and package.json has the API KEY for google Maps

$> npm i

$> ionic cordova prepare

$> ionic cordova run android

```

## Tested on

- [x] Android Device
- [x] Android Simulator
- [ ] IOS

**I have an Ubuntu system. I could only test Android platform. I tried to test the app on a borrowed MAC but could not have access to the system for too long to finish verification.**



## Test-cases executed


Sl.no | Description | Tested-on | Result
------|---------|---------------|--------
1 | App must ask location access permission | Android | PASS
2 | On Deny, App must show a message and exit | Android | PASS
3 | On accept, App must load | Android | PASS
4 | Home Screen must show google map | Android | PASS
6 | Map must be focussed around user's location | Android | PASS
7 | As user location changes, map camera should follow | Android | PASS
8 | User's location must be saved to local DB | Android | PASS
9 | Potrait and Landscape mode must work | Android | PASS
10 | History Tab must show the previous locations | Android | PASS
11 | History tab must show location updates automatically | Android | FAIL (locations captured up until the point are shown.<br> For newer updates screen must be pull-down refreshed)
12 | Indicate if there are no captured locations | Android | Not Yet Implemented. Screen will be empty
13 | Show the count of number of stored locations | Android | Not Implemented
14 | Show the timestamp along with the locaiton | Android | Timestamps are not saved to the DB or displayed at this time
15 | Efficient implementation of DB | Android | Not done. Values are stored/loaded as JSON strings (inefficient when number of entries is large)
16 | Switch off location in between. | Android | FAIL (I noticed that some times, the empty view with error does not appear). This needs to be fixed
17 | Move between both the tabs. | Android | PASS
18 | Move between both the tabs after switching off location. | Android | FAIL (some-times, a white screen appears in Home Tab). This needs to be debugged..
19 | Detect location access being disabled during operation and handle gracefully | Android | FAIL (this area needs some testing and fixes)


## Files and Functionality


File | Description
---------|---------
app/main.ts | is the entry
app/app.component.ts | Main app component. Checks /requests for location access. <br>If the request is accepted app lazy-loads the Tabs, else app exits after displaying an error.
pages/tabs | The tabs component. Houses Home and History tabs..
pages/home | Home component. If location is disabled, display an error.<br> If location is available shows Google map. Google map camera is focussed to the availalbe location.<br> There is a geolocation handler that records change in location every 15 seconds (updates prior to 15 seconds are discarded)<br>Every time location is updated (15-sec window), the map camera is re-set to the new location.<br>The location is also recorded into an arry in local storage (latest first). This implementation of storing points is just function and is not in the most optimal form.<br>
pages/history | Reads the location array from local storage and displays into a scroll list.<br> The scroll-list is *NOT* auto-updated and needs a screen pull-down to refresh.
